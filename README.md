# - 👨🏻 About me: 
  
I've first come across with IT in early 2015 after being approved at the System Analysis and Development graduation course. However, I wasn't really sure if this was the area I'd like to delve myself in and ended up studying something else.

Years passed by and as I was studying Advertising and Publicity, I repeatedly felt gravitated towards studying IT concepts and content and was always amazed with this universe and its possibilites.

In November 2021, I got to know Kenzie Academy Brasil and decided I was going to venture in this area that has always taken my breath.

In the first 3 modules, the focus was on developing front end applications and I got to know and use some code version control tools such as Git and its integration with Github, and also studied and done some projects in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript with functional code and OOP (Object-oriented programming), and React.js besides learning how to consume RESTful APIs. 

The most remarkable segment of this period, apart from the many individual projects, was when I had to develop two projects from scratch along with some teammates facing real challenges, having daily meetings in which we discussed our ideas and searched for solutions when we faced any conflict of code.

Currently, I'm in module 4, which means I've started developing REST APIs with CRUD functionalities by using Node.js.
